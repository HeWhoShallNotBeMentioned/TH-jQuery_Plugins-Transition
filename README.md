## Description

This project is mainly to learn how to use 3 different jQuery plugins. Animsition is used to create page transitions for outgoing and incoming pages on the site. Sticky.js is used to have the navigation bar stick to the top of each page. An additional bar is created on the work page. Nav bar is made responsive for small screen size. Slick.js is used to create carousels on the home page and the team page. The home page is of projects and team is of staff.
